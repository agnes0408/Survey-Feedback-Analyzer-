# Survey Feedback Analyzer

## Project Overview
The **Survey Feedback Analyzer** is a Python-based project designed to analyze textual feedback in any data-driven domain. It focuses on extracting insights, understanding user sentiment, and improving services using core Python programming concepts.

This project demonstrates practical application of Python fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, string operations, dictionaries, and user-defined functions. Users can add new feedback, clean and preprocess text, analyze word frequency, and summarize insights from feedback data.

## Features
- Preloaded sample feedback data including Name, Feedback, and Rating.
- Allows users to dynamically add additional feedbacks.
- Cleans text data by removing punctuation, extra spaces, and normalizing case.
- Analyzes feedback to count occurrences of specific words (e.g., "good", "poor", "excellent").
- Provides summary insights:
  - Average rating
  - Feedback with the longest comment
  - List of unique words across all feedbacks
- Optional: Sort feedbacks by rating from highest to lowest.
